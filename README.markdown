PassThroughRecipes
==================

These are a set of [AndroidWave](https://github.com/pjk25/AndroidWave) Recipes
designed for testing purposes, which simply pass data from a single sensor
through as output. AndroidWave should enforce recipe output rate and precision
limits on these recipes.

This project makes use of git://github.com/pjk25/waverecipealgorithm.git as a
submodule.
